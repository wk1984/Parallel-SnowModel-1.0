The "stations" directory provides examples of processing
met station data.  This directory also includes the MicroMet
preprocessor that can be used to fill in missing station data
(see the original MicroMet paper).

The different (re)analyses names (like: merra2, nldas2,
nora10) provide examples of processing gridded atmospheric
(re)analyses data.

To download the (re)analysis data, edit and run
the "wget_reanalysis_met_gliston.script" in the
"/sm/met/data_download/" directory.
